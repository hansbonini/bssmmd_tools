This package contains the source materials (code/art/script) for the English
translation project for the Mega Drive game Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon.

                    ****************************************
                    
The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the code
is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of effort.
You'll need GCC.

First, build the bundled version of KENS, which is needed to handle the game's
Kosinski compression.

$ cd prg/kens-1.5a1/build
$ cmake ..
$ make

Note that the version of KENS included here is slightly modified from the
original so that the koscmp tool will accept hexadecimal input on the command
line, so trying to substitute an existing installation will not work.

Next, place a ROM image of the original game (e.g. "bssm.md") in the "prg"
directory. To build the patched ROM:

$ cd prg
$ ./build.sh bssm.md bssm_en.md

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated
ROM to bssm_en.md.

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources
that get inserted into the game are coming from.

See COPYING. Basically, everything by me (Supper) is GPLv3. Eien Ni Hen's
translation of the game script is provided under no license, but she assures
me that she's fine with her work being used as a basis for further translations.
